There's a lot to learn about LaTeX!  I'm just recycling old document templates I have from decade+ ago.

I want to learn document classes, packages+options, lots of fine-tuning.  So, I'm working to build up templates
that will (gradually) incorporate more and more classes, options, packages.  And, of course, a host of 'skeleton'
documents is no fun -- I'll try to create some one-off documents from these templates to illustrate their utility.

To start, v0.1:  Following an article at https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Document_Structure, I built out very very basic templates
for document classes (1) article (2) report (3) book (4) slides (5) memoir (6) letter (7) beamer.
Problem is:  no *.cls files were found for 'memoir' and 'beamer'.  So, v0.11 is trying to sort that out -- what's up with *.cls
files for LaTeX???

v0.12:  figure out some standard aspects of document structure for non-article/report/book document classes.  ie, in lieu of abstracts,
chapters, and sections, what goes into slides, letters, etc??

What's next?
v0.2: adding graphics and graphics paths
v0.3: adding some basic packages
v0.4: customizing page dimensions

And, of course, building some basic documents along the way.  For example, a document or two to illustrate the ggplot graphs I'm 
building in my 'basegraphs' project.
