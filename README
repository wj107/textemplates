There's a lot to learn about LaTeX!  I'm just recycling old document templates I have from decade+ ago.

I want to learn document classes, packages+options, lots of fine-tuning.  So, I'm working to build up templates
that will (gradually) incorporate more and more classes, options, packages.  And, of course, a host of 'skeleton'
documents is no fun -- I'll try to create some one-off documents from these templates to illustrate their utility.

To start, v0.1:  Following an article at https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Document_Structure, I built out very very basic templates
for document classes (1) article (2) report (3) book.

Coming soon, v0.11: Templates for (4) slides (5) memoir (6) letter (7) beamer

What's next?
v0.2: adding graphics and graphics paths
v0.3: adding some basic packages
v0.4: customizing page dimensions

And, of course, building some basic documents along the way.  For example, a document or two to illustrate the ggplot graphs I'm 
building in my 'basegraphs' project.
