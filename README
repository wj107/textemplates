There's a lot to learn about LaTeX!  I'm just recycling old document templates I have from decade+ ago.

I want to learn document classes, packages+options, lots of fine-tuning.  So, I'm working to build up templates
that will (gradually) incorporate more and more classes, options, packages.  And, of course, a host of 'skeleton'
documents is no fun -- I'll try to create some one-off documents from these templates to illustrate their utility.

To start, v0.1:  Following an article at https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Document_Structure, I built out very very basic templates
for document classes (1) article (2) report (3) book (4) slides (5) memoir (6) letter (7) beamer.
In order to typeset 'memoir' and 'beamer' documents, we need to install the *.cls files.  That is accomplished by using "tlmgr", the
latex package manager.  However, the debian package "xzdec" needs to be installed prior to using tlmgr -- so after installing that,
I installed 'memoir' package, then completed the skeleton document for memoir.
I followed suit with the 'beamer' package, including the dependencies "etoolbox" and "pgfcore", ***internet time-out, couldn't figure out
the 'beamer' package.  I'll try again once I'm home.

v0.12:  figure out some standard aspects of document structure for non-article/report/book document classes.  ie, in lieu of abstracts,
chapters, and sections, what goes into slides, letters, etc??

What's next?
v0.2: adding graphics and graphics paths
v0.3: adding some basic packages
v0.4: customizing page dimensions

And, of course, building some basic documents along the way.  For example, a document or two to illustrate the ggplot graphs I'm 
building in my 'basegraphs' project.
